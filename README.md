Face detection on the webcam with openCV-python

Face detection is made instantly using the webcam.
Just add the webcamFaceDetection.py file and the cascade files to the same directory and compile the code with any compiler.
Also, python code, which detects both face and eyes at the same time, has been added to the study.
